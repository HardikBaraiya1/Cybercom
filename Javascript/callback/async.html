    <!-- 
        "I will finish later!"

        Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

        A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()
     -->
     <script>
        function show(){
            document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>You spend 3secs Already!!!</h2>';

        }

        setTimeout(() => {
            document.body.innerHTML = '<h2 style="color:red">You spend 5secs Already!!!</h2>';
        }, 5000);

        setTimeout(show,3000);
        // In the example above, myFunction is used as a callback.

        // myFunction is passed to setInterval() as an argument.

        // 1000 is the number of milliseconds between intervals, so myFunction() will be called every second.

     </script>
</body>
</html>


<!-- 
    When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.

        Right: setTimeout(myFunction, 3000);

        Wrong: setTimeout(myFunction(), 3000);
 -->



 <!-- 
    With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.

But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.

Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
